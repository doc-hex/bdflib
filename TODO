 - We probably want to recursively de-compose characters: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   A WITH MACRON AND CEDILLA tends to decompose to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH
   MACRON and COMBINING CEDILLA.
   - Alternatively, topologically-sort decompositions before use.
 - Support adding customizable decompositions for glyphs that can be
   graphically but not semantically composed; for example you might build
   a combining slash, the fraction slash etc. from "/". Also, "LATIN CAPITAL
   LETTER O WITH STROKE" doesn't have a decomposition in the Unicode-data, but
   it would be helpful if it could be built from "O" and "/".
 - Support *only* using customized decompositions, not the unicode
   decompositions. This should make testing "useful glyphs you don't have"
   functionality easier.
 - Support for charcell/monospaced fonts. This would involve ignoring
   decompositions with spacing characters (Dz -> "D", "z"), or maybe just
   ignoring any decompositions that went outside the defined character cell.

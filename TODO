 - Update model and writer so they output BDF files that can be easily diffed
   with the output of gbdfed (in particular, output bitmaps padded to bytes,
   not nybbles).
 - Fix handling of the SIZE and POINT_SIZE properties.
 - Decomposed sequences that start with "i" and a composing character with the
   'above' class should be hacked to start with dotless-i instead.
 - We probably want to recursively de-compose characters: LATIN CAPITAL LETTER
   A WITH MACRON AND CEDILLA tends to decompose to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A WITH
   MACRON and COMBINING CEDILLA.

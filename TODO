 - Add a standard set of extra compositions that are useful for font-building,
   such as characters WITH STROKE.
 - Support more combining classes.
 - Support for charcell/monospaced fonts. This would involve ignoring
   decompositions with spacing characters (Dz -> "D", "z"), or maybe just
   ignoring any decompositions that went outside the defined character cell.
